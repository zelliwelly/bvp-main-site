              Monk v. United States is a landmark federal lawsuit filed by Black Veterans Project and our legal partners challenging systemic racial discrimination in the VA benefits system. The case alleges that the Department of Veterans Affairs has systematically denied or underrated disability benefits claims from Black veterans at higher rates than white veterans.
            </p>
            <p>
              The case seeks both systemic reform of VA practices and compensation for affected veterans. It represents one of the most significant civil rights actions in veterans' affairs history.

            Eligibility for the Monk case depends on specific criteria related to denied or underrated VA benefits claims.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Filing a Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) claim requires specific procedures and deadlines. You must file an administrative claim with the VA within two years of the alleged harm, and the VA has six months to respond before you can file in federal court.
            </p>
            <p>
              We strongly recommend consulting with a veterans' rights attorney before filing an FTCA claim. Our legal partners at Yale Law School's Veterans Legal Services Clinic may be able to assist with complex cases.

        answer: (
          <p>
            Surviving family members may have standing to pursue certain claims related to denied benefits. The rules depend on factors including the type of benefit, when the denial occurred, and your relationship to the veteran. We recommend consulting with a veterans' benefits attorney to understand your options.

        question: "How do I appeal a denied VA disability claim?",

          <p>
            The VA has a multi-step appeals process including Supplemental Claims, Higher-Level Review, and Board of Veterans' Appeals review. Each option has different requirements and timelines. Free assistance is available through Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs), accredited claims agents, and legal aid clinics specializing in veterans' benefits.

          <p>
            Documentation may include VA correspondence, application records, military discharge papers (DD-214), and historical records from educational institutions. The National Archives and National Personnel Records Center maintain military records. For descendants seeking to document historical discrimination, our team can provide guidance on research approaches.
